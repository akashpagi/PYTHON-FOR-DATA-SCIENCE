Problem 11: 
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps.
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:

UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
!
The numbers after the direction are steps.
! means robot stop there.
Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point.
If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Example:
Input:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
!
Output:
2

Problem 12:
Write a program to print whether a given number is a prime number or not

Problem 13:
Print all the Armstrong numbers in a given range.
Range will be provided by the user
Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.

Problem 14:
Calculate the angle between the hour hand and minute hand.
Note: There can be two angles between hands; we need to print a minimum of two. 
Also, we need to print the floor of the final result angle. For example, if the final angle is 10.61, we need to print 10.
Input:
H = 9 , M = 0
Output:
90
Explanation:
The minimum angle between hour and minute hand when the time is 9 is 90 degress.


Problem 15:
Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. 
A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle.
Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping. 
(L1 and R1 are the extreme points of the first rectangle and L2 and R2 are the extreme points of the second rectangle).
Note: It may be assumed that the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis.
